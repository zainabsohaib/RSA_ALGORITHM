##PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
We are working on rsa cryptography which has two functions encryption and decryption . First we  enter the plain text by taking user input and then by clicking on encrypt button it will hide the text and encrypted messages can be deciphered only by using secret key then by clicking on decrypt button it will bring the text in original format and we have used hash functions also to fixed-size values .

##DISCRETE MATH CONCEPTS USED :
* Public key cryptosystem : it is used in our encryption and decryption method as it uses pair of keys public and secret keys .
* Block cipher : it is used in our project to encrypt block of text as shift cipher is for one byte but we used block cipher so we can encrypt text of large length also .
* Hash function : it is use in encrytion and decryption method both to fix the size of values
