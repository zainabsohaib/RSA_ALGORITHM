## PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
We are working on cryptography which has two techniques to perform encryption and decryption and those are: MD5 and RSA. First we  enter the plain text by taking user input and then by clicking on encrypt button it will give you encrypted messages that can be deciphered only by using secret key then by clicking on decrypt button it will bring the text in original format and we have used hash functions also to fixed-size values.
And for RSA system we use built-in classes that is: RSACryptoServiceProvider. 

## DISCRETE MATH CONCEPTS USED :
* Public Key and Private Key : it is used in our encryption and decryption method as it uses pair of keys public and secret keys .
* Block cipher : it is used in our project to encrypt block of text as shift cipher is for one byte but we used block cipher so we can encrypt text of large length also.
* Hash function : it is use in encrytion and decryption method both to fix the size of values .

## PROBLEMS FACED :

### PROBLEM 1:
As it is a quite difficult subject so we faced many diffitulties to choose this project .

### PROBLEM 2:
We were unable to understand exact code of rsa algorithm and also faced difficulty in dividing this small code among four members. So we decided to implement a new technique in cryptosystem that is: MD5. It helped us to easily distribute the tasks to each memeber.

### PROBLEM 3:
First we were using shift cipher and when we were entering large text in textbox it was not able to encrypt that text we were not able to recognize the error after spending many hours we came to conclusion that we should use block cipher so user can enter large input and be flexible to take input of large or small length both .
