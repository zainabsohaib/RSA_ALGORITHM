## PROJECT : CRYPTOSYSTEM


## PROJECT DETAILS :
We have developed a Crypto System where we have used two methods to perform Encryption and Decryption of text. The first one is MD5 Encryption/Decryption and second one is RSA Encryption/Decryption.

MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4,[4] and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321.

This MD5 algorithm is very commonly used in the world. It is a hash function that produces 128-bit hash value. As MD5 was initially developed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been stated to suffer from extensive vulnerabilitites. This method can still be used as a checksum to prove data integrity. it is suited for various non-cryptographic purposes, for instance, for determining the partition for a specific key in a partitioned database.
MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4.

RSA is an encryption decryption algorithm.Developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.The RSA algorithm is the most commonly used public key encryption algorithm.Two keys are used public key(for encryption) and private key(for decryption).Both users (sender and receiver) generates a public and private key. Public Key is shared with the public that wants to send us data. Private Key is Kept secret so that when someone sends us data encrypted by our Public Key, we can decrypt the data using the Private Key.It will be on windows form and we will use security.cryptography library.We will make 2 functions encryption and decryption .
