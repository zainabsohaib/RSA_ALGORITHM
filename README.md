PROJECT : RSA ALGORITHM


PROJECT DETAILS :
RSA is an encryption algorithm.Developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.The RSA algorithm is the most commonly used public key encryption algorithm.Two keys are used public key(for encryption) and private key(for decryption).Both users (sender and receiver) generates a public and private key. Public Key is shared with the public that wants to send us data. Private Key is Kept secret so that when someone sends us data encrypted by our Public Key, we can decrypt the data using the Private Key.It will be on windows form and we will use security.cryptography library. We will use the RSACryptoServiceProvider class to encrypt a string into an array of bytes and then decrypt the bytes back into a string.We will make 2 functions encryption and decryption .
